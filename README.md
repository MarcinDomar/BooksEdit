# BooksEdit
I treated the project as a training ground for learning JavaScript

## Project contains solution for task:
Write a web application called Book Collection Editor with which you will be able to add, remove or change book items. The book's record should have fields title, author, year of publication, description.

The master branch contains "pure" JS and needs a php server configuration, while the masterQj branch is written using the jQuery library and contains a page simulating work with the server allowing you to add and remove books, the above functionality has been provided with appropriate animations.
To test it, open the BooksEdit.html file in the browser from the masterQj branch.
